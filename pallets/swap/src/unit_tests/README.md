The input directory is data for unit test in which "pk.json" is public key and other files are sign.
Content of json file is created in zkp repo which is also used to generate input.json for circom. The input.json is valid because unit_run_full.sh in zkp/circom/tools can be ran successfully in zkp repo. So the data in input directory is valid.
